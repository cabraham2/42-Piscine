42 Piscine - Clément ABRAHAM

Welcome to my 42 Piscine repository! Here you’ll find my work from the August Piscine at 42, where I finished among the top 3 out of 150 students. Through 288 hours of continuous work, I tackled challenging C programming exercises, shell scripts, and collaborative projects. This repository showcases my progress, skills, and the projects I completed.

🌊 About the Piscine

The 42 Piscine is an intensive, four-week coding bootcamp at École 42. Each week presents new challenges, including exams, collaborative “rush” projects, and dozens of coding exercises in C and shell. The goal? To push participants to their limits and foster self-sufficiency, resilience, and teamwork.

Special Thanks 💫

A huge thank you to my friend [Eliam, Léo, Paul, Gaspart, Ewen, Nilse, Antoine and many other] for the endless support, late-night debugging sessions, and encouragement throughout the 42 Piscine journey. Couldn’t have done it without you! 🙌

🏆 Key Skills Developed

Throughout the Piscine, I strengthened these core skills:

	•	C Programming: From basics to advanced topics like dynamic memory management and data structures.
	•	Algorithms: Implementing efficient sorting, searching, and file-handling algorithms.
	•	Shell Scripting: Mastering command line, scripting, and file operations.
	•	Problem Solving: Tackling complex problems methodically.
	•	Peer Collaboration: Learning from and working with other students in rush projects and reviews.
